<h2 align="left">Hey! My name is Gil Teixeira and I'm a Fullstack Developer.</h2>
<h5>
Please keep in mind that this stats aren't totally accurate. I've done almost no work in prolog. But this are the most accurate global stats one can get without using the github API key! Also because of this some projects, set to private as the code belongs to companies, isn't being counted either. I've a lot of experience with C, Python3, NodeJS, ReactJS and React Native and have already contributed to Expo. Please check my website for a better overview of my work!
